		<p>The tulip is native to the Tien Shan mountain region. Records show it was cultivated in Istanbul as early as 1055. In 1554, Ogier Ghiselih de Busbecq, the ambassador to the sultan of Turkey, sent seeds to Vienna, where Carlos Clusius headed the botanical garden.</p>

		<p>Entrepreneurs began establishing nurseries aroudn the Netherlands at the start of the 17th century and soon tulip collecting took off. Tulips were exported to Berlin, Paris, and the Kew gardens in London. Within a year, the price of tulips more than doubled and speculators took advantage of the market. By the 1620s, single-colored varieties were selling for 12 florins a pound, while the average annal income was about 150 florins. By 1637, sellers began to outnumber buyers and the market collapsed. The Netherlands remains one of the largest exporters of bulbs today. <img src=/img/tulip_price_index-01.jpg width="400" margin="50"></p>
		<p>The tulip came to the United States around 1698, as Dutch emigrants moved to the US.</p>

		<h1>THE WORLD OF FLOWERS</h1>
		<div id='info-window-body'>
			<p>"Emblazoned with beauty, this floral map shows the origins of 117 of man's favorite flowers. As people began to move from one part of the world to another, they carried plants with them. Explorers, conquerors, and adventurers returned to their homelands with flowers from far-off places. Colonists carried seeds and bulbs to the New World. Some have done so well in their adopted regions that their beginnings are seldom remembered."</p>
